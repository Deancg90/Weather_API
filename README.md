# Weather_API
First API python script, This pulls data from https://openweathermap.org/ and displays it to the user. 
It converts temperatures from kelvin, the standard SI unit, to celcius. The user has the option 
to display this in fahrenheit, although i'm not sure why anyone would want to do that.

A user account will need to be made on the website in order for an API key to be generated.

The city, along with the specified data which is pulled is also user dependent, these can be changed 
in the code.
